# Data Encryption App

This is a simple program that demonstrates encrypting text, writing to a file, reading that file, and decrypting the text. I used C# and .net Maui to make this encryption demo for my CIT368 class. For my encryption, I used AES by importing System.Security.Cryptography.

To use the program, download the release and install the program. Trust the certificate and run the installer. You may need to add the certificate to your local "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store. Enter some data in the field and click encrypt. Now your data is encrypted using AES and saved to your appdata. You will see your decrypted data shown as a confirmation that your data was saved successfully.
